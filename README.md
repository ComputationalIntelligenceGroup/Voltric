**Voltric** is an open source software library for clustering with Bayesian networks that is being developed by researchers of the Polythecnic University of Madrid. While still on early development, Voltric aspires at being an important tool in the Data science ecosystem. Voltric provides a framework for developing new algorithms based on Bayesian networks, it also their computational and interpreational advatanges to provide a set of already implemented methods that belong to the State of the art.
